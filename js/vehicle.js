 * SUPERMINE — js/vehicle.js                        [OWNER: Agent 2 — gameplay]
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE MACHINE. Drawn entirely procedurally from modular parts so that every
 * upgrade visibly ADDS or ENLARGES machinery. Nothing here is a sprite; the
 * whole rig is rebuilt from `parts` levels every frame.
 *
 *                   [ drill heads ]        <- front (-y)
 *              ======[ cutting blade ]======
 *               \\                      //
 *      (grinder)[tr][    chassis    ][tr](grinder)
 *                   [    cabin      ]
 *               \__ [    hopper     ] __/  <- magnet arms
 *                   [   conveyor    ]      <- rear (+y)
 *
 * Everything animates every frame: drums spin, drill heads rotate, grinder
 * discs counter-rotate, treads scroll, the conveyor belt runs, pistons pump,
 * exhausts puff, warning lights strobe. When a part is installed it UNFOLDS
 * (deploy timer 0..1 with an overshooting ease).
 *
 * ADVENTURE MODE DRAWS A DIFFERENT MACHINE FROM THE SAME PARTS. The diagram
 * above is the TIME ATTACK rig, built by UPGRADE_EFFECTS. Adventure's geometry
 * comes from SM.rig.getPartFlags(), and its two big subassemblies are their own
 * thing because they have to communicate a SHOP LADDER rather than a pickup:
 *
 *              [ point ]                    <- front (-y)
 *             [[ auger ]]                   drawDrillRig()  — the DRILL tiers:
 *          ===[ reamer bar ]===             one bit that gets longer, thicker,
 *      [tr][      chassis      ][tr]        deeper-fluted, then hot, then lit
 *          [   intake throat   ]            drawIntake()    — where ore goes in
 *          [ bay 0: the load   ]            drawOreBed()    — the CARGO tiers:
 *          [ bay 1 ] [ bay 2 ]              a tub that grows into an ore train
 *
 * The seam is `advMode()` and it is taken in exactly two places, both inside
 * drawMachine(). Everything else — tracks, chassis, cabin, exhaust, lamps,
 * radiators, armour, dish — is shared and identical in both modes.
 *
 * Public API (main.js / particles.js / camera.js / effects.js depend on these —
 * do NOT change the signatures):
 *   SM.vehicle.init() / reset() / update(dt) / render(ctx)
 *   SM.vehicle.getX() getY() getWidth() getSpeed() getMiningPower() getCollectRadius()
 *   SM.vehicle.applyUpgrade(id) / getUpgradeEffect(id)
 *   SM.vehicle.getBladeWidth() getBladeFrontY() getBank() getLateralSpeed()
 *   SM.vehicle.getResistance() isTransforming() getUpgradeCount() getStat(name)
 * Phase-2 additions (safe to call, not required by main.js):
 *   SM.vehicle.getValueMultiplier() getPartLevel(name) getOverdrive()
 *   SM.vehicle.startOverdrive(seconds)
 * Time-attack additions (the HUD is built against exactly these):
 *   SM.vehicle.getOwnedUpgrades()   LIVE, READ-ONLY [{id,title,level}, ...] in
 *                                   acquisition order; rebuilt only when an
 *                                   upgrade is applied, never per frame
 *   SM.vehicle.getUpgradeVersion()  bumps on every applyUpgrade() — cheap
 *                                   change detection for the HUD
 *   SM.vehicle.halt() / isHalted()  the "time is up" stop
 *
 * Events emitted
 *   vehicle:transform  {part, width}    a part was added / enlarged
 *   pulse:fired        {x, y, radius}   explosive pulse detonated
 *   overdrive:start    {duration}
 *   overdrive:end      {}
 *   boost:start        {duration}      one per BOOST BLOCK, not per fragment:
 *                                      `duration` is the whole block's worth,
 *                                      and the HUD prints it, so it is emitted
 *                                      only after the cloud has stopped

   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   * THE FEEL WE ARE AFTER, because every number below only makes sense against
   * it: a TRACKED DIGGER chewing through material that closes around it. Not a
   * cursor, not a ship. Three things sell it and there is no gravity to help:
   *
   *   1. IT TAKES A MOMENT TO GET GOING. Thrust is an acceleration budget, not
   *      a velocity assignment, so a tap of the stick leans the machine and a
   *      held stick winds it up. ADV_SPINUP is the whole difference between
   *      "heavy" and "floaty", so tune it before anything else.
   *   2. IT ONLY PULLS HARD IN THE DIRECTION IT FACES. The hull swings toward
   *      the stick at ADV_TURN rad/s and thrust is scaled by how well the two
   *      agree (down to ADV_ALIGN_MIN when they do not), so reversing means
   *      turning around, and turning is something the machine visibly DOES.
   *   3. IT GRINDS TO A HALT AGAINST ROCK. Surviving hardness under the bit
   *      becomes resistance becomes lost speed, exactly as in classic; and rock
   *      above SM.rig.getHardnessCap() is not slow, it is a WALL.
   *
   * THE DRILL DAMAGE BOX IS A SQUARE AROUND THE BIT, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
   * particles.damageSolidInRect() is axis-aligned and particles.js is frozen,
   * so there is no rotated rect to be had. The bit, however, is a round drill
   * head: a square centred on it is rotation-INVARIANT, which means the cut is
   * identical whichever way the machine is pointing — the correct answer here
   * rather than a compromise. Debris still erupts outward because the origin
   * handed to the cutter is the bit centre itself.
   *
   * WHY THERE IS A SECOND, WEAKER BOX ON THE HULL
   * The bit cuts a corridor ADV_CUT_HALF*2 wide, which the machine fits down.
   * Spinning on the spot, though, sweeps the chassis corners through rock the
   * bit never touched, and there is no vehicle-versus-solid collision in this
   * engine — the hull would simply be drawn standing inside the ground. So the
   * hull grinds too, at ADV_HULL_GRIND of drill power: enough to clear its own
   * flanks over a second or two, never enough to be a way of mining.

   * A LEVEL IS ITS OWN MAP (ADVENTURE.md §2b) and its lift is BIG DOORS at the

   * directly below them, ON the centre line, FACING DOWN — pointing at the level,
   * which is the only direction there is anything in.
   *
   * FACING MATTERS BEYOND LOOKS: the drill, the collector and the hull's own
   * grind box all sit along the facing, so a machine that arrived facing up would
   * spend its first second chewing the chamber's ceiling — and its ore bed trails
   * the OTHER way, which is what sizes the chamber (see advterrain's DOOR_RY).

   * where the old west-edge park had 35 — the lateral offset that ate the rest of
   * it existed only because the landings opened one way, and a central lift has no
   * use for it. It is also what test assertions of the form
   * |getDepthM() - level.depthM| < 12 are written against (ADVENTURE.md §2b quotes

  var ADV_CORE_HALF = 26;        // the bit proper, for the hardness gate

  /* --- resistance: SECONDS OF WORK, not summed hardness -----------------
   * Classic slows the machine by the summed hardness of what its blade FAILED
   * to break this step. Measured in adventure, that model is nearly flat: a
   * drill four, eight, sixteen times too weak for the rock in front of it still
   * ploughed along at 94-96% of top speed, because the quantity only ever
   * reflects the ABSOLUTE hardness of the material — dirt contributes 0.55 to
   * it whether your drill can eat it in a tenth of a second or a whole one.
   * (Full sweep: power 8 -> 96%, power 4 -> 98%, power 2 -> 95%, power 1.2 ->
   * 96%, power 0.8 -> 95%, power 0.5 -> 94%. A sixteen-fold difference in drill
   * strength was worth two percent of speed.)
   *
   * That is fatal for this mode specifically, because adventure's whole
   * progression is "the same rock, a better drill" — a tier-5 bit that moved
   * through granite at exactly the tier-0 speed makes the workshop a shop for
   * hardness caps and nothing else.
   *
   * So the load term here is the honest quantity instead:
   *
   *     load = (total hardness standing in front of the bit) / drill power
   *
   * which is SECONDS OF WORK AHEAD. It falls when the rock is softer AND when
   * the drill is stronger, it is already free (the hardness gate's pre-scan
   * sums it), and it reads directly as "how long is this wall going to take".
   * MEASURED with this model live, driving into virgin ground, expressing each
   * rock as the drill-power ratio that reproduces it (load, then % of top):
   *     dirt 0.55   ->   3 s ->  95%      sandstone 2.2  ->  34 s -> 63%
   *     clay 1.1    ->   5 s ->  92%      granite 6.2    ->  67 s -> 46%
   *     obsidian    -> 267 s ->  34% (the VEHICLE_MIN_SPEED_FACTOR floor)
   * The floor still bites, so there is headroom left for the deep mines, and
   * the knee sits where it should: soft ground is free, rock is a decision.
   * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */
  /* RETUNED — the SHAPE as well as the coefficient, and both for measured
   * reasons.
   *
   * 0.017 with a linear 1/(1+kL) was solved when the tier-0 drill had 21 power
   * and virgin ground measured 3 to 267 "seconds of work". rig.js now ships tier
   * 0 at 8.0 power, and the quantity it multiplies has moved with it: MEASURED
   * live, the load while cutting the top layers of Old Creek is 0.1 to 0.7, and
   * the load standing in front of the bit in granite is 50+. At 0.017 the first
   * of those is a 2% slowdown, so drilling ran at the full rated 110 units/sec —
   * indistinguishable from driving down an open corridor, which erases the whole
   * point of owning a better drill.
   *
   * The linear form cannot fix that by coefficient alone, because the load spans
   * nearly three decades: any k that makes soft ground meaningfully slow puts
   * every real rock on the floor, and a floor is not a difficulty curve. THE
   * SQRT DOES: it is gentle where the load is small and keeps resolving where the
   * load is large.
   *
   *     factor = 1 / (1 + k * sqrt(load)),  k = 1.45
   *         load 0.1  (soft dirt, overpowered)  -> 0.69 x
   *         load 0.5  (clay)                    -> 0.49 x
   *         load 2    (stone)                   -> 0.33 x
   *         load 10   (granite for a tier-0 bit)-> 0.18 x
   *         load 50   (a face it can only just cut) -> the floor
   *
   * MEASURED in Old Creek with the tier-0 bit: the descent runs 3 to 6 m/s and
   * the climb back up the same corridor runs 14.5 m/s. The range cost of that is
   * real and it is reported — see the note on advReportWork().
   *
   * Against the 2.5x travel gear that is 3x to 20x between cutting and running,
   * which is the rhythm the mode is built on. And because load is hardness over
   * POWER, every drill tier buys that pace back in the same rock — the upgrade is
   * FELT rather than read off a stat card.
   *
   * There is a feedback loop in here worth knowing about before you touch k:
   * cutting slower leaves the cut box emptier, which lowers the load, which
   * speeds you up. It is self-limiting and it is why the coefficient had to be
   * measured in the mine rather than solved on paper.
   *
   * The floor is ours rather than config's VEHICLE_MIN_SPEED_FACTOR (0.34): that
   * number is the time attack's, where the machine must never stop making
   * progress against the clock. Here a face you can only just cut SHOULD be a
   * crawl, and the hardness gate stops it ever being an infinite one. */

  /* --- TRAVEL vs DRILLING: two gears, and why the fuel follows ----------
   * Drilling pace and travelling pace are different jobs. Chewing a fresh face
   * is meant to be slow; crawling back up two hundred metres of tunnel you
   * already dug at that same pace is just the player waiting, and the round trip
   * is the loop this mode is built out of. So when the bit has nothing in front
   * of it — an open cavern, or your own corridor — the machine runs at
   * ADV_TRAVEL_MUL of its rated speed, and the moment the bit bites it gears
   * back down over ADV_TRAVEL_RAMP.
   *
   * The gate is `advLoad`, the seconds of work ahead of the bit, because it is
   * already the honest answer to "is this machine digging or driving".
   * MEASURED, tier-0 rig, 8.0 drill power: cutting virgin ground reads 0.60 to
   * 2.94 (mean 1.14 — it swings because the cut clears the box faster than the
   * machine can advance into it), and reversing back up the corridor it just
   * carved reads a flat 0.00. So the thresholds sit low and close together: any
   * real cutting is drilling pace, and your own tunnel is the top gear.
   *
   * A footprint-based signal was tried first — hardness within one bit radius —
   * and MEASURED USELESS: damageSolidInRect() clears the whole 168-wide box, so
   * the bit is permanently sitting in a void of its own making and the number
   * read 0.04 while drilling. The box total is the one that carries the answer.
   *
   * FUEL SCALES WITH THE SAME NUMBER, and that is not optional. rig.js's tank
   * sizes and mines.js's depths are solved against fuel per METRE; leaving the
   * burn at its old per-SECOND rate while the machine covers 2.5x the ground
   * would hand every tank 2.5x the range and quietly undo that balance. See
   * advReportWork() — the drive term is multiplied by advTravel, so a metre of
   * tunnel costs exactly what it did, and only the clock moves.

  // came out under the threshold, the gate never fired, and the cutter chewed
  // hardness-26 bedrock at about 1.2 s a deposit while the hull slowly died.

   *            only cue that survives being small on a phone.
   *   WALL     wall thickness IS wall height in a top-down view: the rim band
   *            you see around the cavity is the top of the plate, so a thicker
   *            rim plus a deeper inner shadow is a taller side. This is the
   *            "high-sided" tier's entire job.
   *   FILL     the cavity is drawn empty and the load is drawn INTO it, from
   *            SM.adv.getCargoPct(). A bigger bed therefore looks emptier with
   *            the same ore in it, which is exactly what the upgrade bought.
   *
   * Nothing here reaches outboard. The old collector arms were the widest thing
   * on the machine and read as antennae; the magnet is now an INTAKE THROAT on
   * the deck (drawIntake) plus the collector rings that were always there.

   * folded into the head as collars and shoulder cutters instead of being bolted
   * on as separate machinery, which was the thing that read as "more discs".
