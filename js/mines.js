 *
 * A LAYER (ordered shallow -> deep; advterrain.js picks by depth in metres)

 *
 * BALANCE CONTRACT WITH js/rig.js AND js/advterrain.js
 *   Contact time is roughly BLADE_DEPTH / speed. A deposit is drillable without
 *   stalling when  hardness * hardnessScale < drillPower * contactTime. That is
 *   the whole "your drill cannot get through that yet" gate — express a mine's
 *   difficulty as HARDNESS, not as a lockout, so an under-gunned player is slow
 *   and burns fuel rather than being told no.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * ================  AGENT-2 DESIGN NOTES — READ BEFORE TUNING  ================
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * 1. THE ONE EQUATION THE WHOLE CURVE RESTS ON
 *
 *    js/particles.js applies the cutter's FULL damage to EVERY deposit inside
 *    the blade rectangle, independently. So for the blade to advance one deposit
 *    pitch it has to spend `hardness / drillPower` seconds, and the machine's
 *    advance rate through solid material of hardness h is
 *
 *        v_drill  ~=  min( freeSpeed,  SPACING * drillPower / h )      units/s
 *
 *    Sanity check against the shipped classic game, which is already tuned and
 *    which nobody is allowed to argue with: TERRAIN_SPACING 18, power 21,
 *    VEHICLE_SPEED 200.  Stone (h 2.1) -> 18*21/2.1 = 180 u/s, i.e. ~90% of full
 *    speed, which is exactly how stone feels.  Granite (h 6.2) -> 61 u/s = 30%,
 *    and VEHICLE_MIN_SPEED_FACTOR is 0.34.  The model is right.
 *
 *    audit() below evaluates that equation over the whole catalogue at every
 *    drill tier, which is how these numbers were checked rather than guessed.
 *
 * 2. DIFFICULTY IS RATE, NOT PERMISSION
 *
 *    Two levers, and they do different jobs on purpose:
 *
 *      drillPower  is the CURVE. Every mine is physically enterable with the
 *                  starting auger — Deep Hollow's dead granite just advances at
 *                  ~25% of a slow machine's speed, which means the run costs
 *                  three tanks of fuel and comes up with nothing. The player
 *                  loses money, learns why, and buys a drill. That is the brief.
 *
 *      hardnessCap is the LATE WALL. Exactly three materials sit above the
 *                  starting cap of 8.5: the ANCIENT FORMATION (9.5), OBSIDIAN
 *                  (16) and BEDROCK (26). All three appear only as POCKETS, as
 *                  wall linings or as the mine floor — never as a layer's bulk
 *                  `fill` — so an uncuttable material is always something you
 *                  route around, never a floor you cannot get past.
 *
 *    >> TWO INVARIANTS, do not break either. audit() reports both per layer and
 *    >> the smoke test asserts them:
 *    >>   fillBlocked      every layer's `fill` must be below
 *    >>                    SM.rig.getHardnessCap() at drill tier 0, or that mine
 *    >>                    becomes physically unenterable.
 *    >>   fillIsSellable   every layer's `fill` must be SPOIL (volumeOf === 0).
 *    >>                    A sellable bulk rock fills the hold with the ground
 *    >>                    itself in seconds and the cargo decision evaporates.
 *
 *    Note that the FOUR softest ore materials — coal 1.5, copper 3.0, silver 3.6,
 *    uranium 4.4 — are all cuttable from the first minute. Uranium in particular
 *    is gated by HEAT and by DEPTH, not by the drill; that is deliberate, and it
 *    is why cooling is a real category rather than a tax.
 *
 * 3. WHY VOLUME AND PRICE ARE SEPARATE NUMBERS
 *
 *    priceOf() is dollars per cargo UNIT; volumeOf() is how many units ONE
 *    deposit occupies. The hold is bounded in units, so what a run is worth is
 *    `cargoCap * (dollars per unit of what you chose to carry)`, and the spread
 *    of dollars-per-unit across the table IS the "dump the coal" decision:
 *
 *        coal      $7/unit  x 4 units/deposit  =  $28  a deposit,  $7/unit
 *        gold    $165/unit  x 1 unit /deposit  = $165  a deposit, $165/unit
 *
 *    24x per unit of hold. Standing on a gold seam with a hold full of coal, the
 *    coal is costing you $158 per unit it occupies. That has to be obvious from
 *    the manifest without any tutorial, which is why the ratio is this violent.
 *
 *    Volume 0 means "not cargo at all" (dirt, stone, granite, obsidian, the
 *    classic power-up cells). js/adv.js can offer anything it collects to
 *    offerCargo() and spoil will simply never consume the hold. priceOf and
 *    volumeOf are zero together, always.
 *
 * 4. THE INCOME LADDER, AND WHY THE STEPS ARE THIS SIZE
 *
 *    `rate` is dollars per unit of HOLD from a mine's deepest layer — the number
 *    a player who works a mine properly earns, because they dump the cheap ore
 *    and refill from the richest seam they can stand in. `net` is one full tank,
 *    at the recDrill tier, AFTER paying for the fuel, from the one-tank model
 *    described in note 4b. Every figure below was measured, not chosen:
 *
 *        mine          rate  recDrill  hold    net    rights   $/sec of run
 *        Old Creek      $12      8      48    $448      free       $3
 *        Red Ridge      $36     13      80  $2 684    $1 600      $14
 *        Blackstone    $131     21     130 $16 726   $18 000      $72
 *        Frostpeak     $293     35     210 $60 879   $44 000     $216
 *        Deep Hollow   $305     35     210 $63 344   $48 000     $225
 *        Cinder Fell   $677     55     330 $222 340 $185 000     $669
 *        The Rift    $1 187     84     520 $615 362 $420 000   $1 553
 *
 *    THE RULE THAT MATTERS IS THE LAST COLUMN, READ AT A FIXED TIER. A deeper
 *    mine costs more MINUTES per run, so its rate has to beat the previous
 *    mine's by MORE than the extra round trip costs, or the new mine is strictly
 *    a worse use of an afternoon and the player correctly ignores it.
 *
 *    Blackstone originally failed exactly this test — it paid the same per second
 *    as Red Ridge, and a simulated greedy player stayed in Red Ridge for thirty
 *    runs rather than use the rights it had just bought — which is why its Gold
 *    Pocket layer is as rich as it is. Re-check this column after any retune.
 *
 * 4a. FROSTPEAK IS A FORK, NOT A RUNG
 *
 *    Frostpeak used to cost $96 000 and sit above Deep Hollow, and measurement
 *    killed that: it paid ~4% LESS per second at every tier, for twice the
 *    rights. Strictly dominated, and no amount of flavour text fixes a mine that
 *    is simply the worse option.
 *
 *    So it is now $44 000 against Deep Hollow's $48 000 and the two are a CHOICE
 *    at the same point on the map. They cost the same, they pay within 4% of
 *    each other, and they ask for completely different machines:
 *
 *        Deep Hollow   heat 0.50 on the floor -> at cooling tier 0 you have
 *                      about 29 seconds in the payload layer before the needle
 *                      tops; tier 2 is the first that holds station there.
 *        Frostpeak     heat 0.00 in EVERY layer -> you can stand in the Crystal
 *                      Vaults indefinitely with the radiator you started with.
 *                      It charges for that with the hardest non-granite rock in
 *                      the game (hardnessScale 1.20 on limestone) and 4% less
 *                      money, so it wants DRILL and FUEL instead of COOLING.
 *
 *    That is a real decision about which upgrade you bought last, which is worth
 *    far more than another rung. Do not "fix" the 4% — it is what makes the
 *    cheaper mine the better one for a player with a weak radiator.
 *
 * 4b. THE ONE-TANK MODEL, AND THE TWO MARGINAL TIERS
 *
 *    A mine's income is not `hold x rate`; it is bounded by the FUEL left over
 *    once the climb out has been reserved. Deep Hollow at machine tier 1 reaches
 *    the bottom with enough fuel for 16 of its 80 units, and The Rift at tier 2
 *    with enough for 6 of 130. Both therefore pay WORSE per second than the
 *    cheaper mine above them at that one tier, and both flip violently one tier
 *    later ($25 -> $169/s and $30 -> $601/s).
 *
 *    That is not a hole in the curve, it is the most interesting moment in it:
 *    "I can get down there, and I can't do anything when I arrive." The fix the
 *    player reaches for is the tank and the hold, and the mine transforms. Do not
 *    flatten it.
 *
 *    Rights are 1.5-4 runs of the PREVIOUS mine, so buying in is a decision you
 *    make after a good week rather than a grind. Total campaign income needed:
 *    ~$2.60M of workshop plus ~$0.72M of rights. A simulated player who always
 *    buys the cheapest available upgrade — the worst case — owns every mine
 *    after ~57 runs and has a maxed machine after ~62, which is about 95 minutes
 *    of in-mine time.
 *
 * 4c. LEVELS — THE LIFT'S PRICE LIST, AND WHY THE GEOLOGY SETS IT
 *
 *    The mine entrance is a LIFT. A company buys STATIONS down the shaft and
 *    rides to them for free, so a purchased level is not a shortcut: it is the
 *    only way to spend a whole tank WORKING a stratum instead of driving to it.
 *
 *    RE-CUT AS BANDS (ADVENTURE.md §2b): level k IS layer k, each level is its
 *    own map, and LEVEL 1 IS FREE — it comes with the mining rights. The layer
 *    table is still the price list and every price is unchanged; only the index
 *    moved, because band i>=2 opens the stratum old level i-1 opened. Levels
 *    also carry a WIDTH now (widthU, see WIDTH_BASE): deeper is bigger, and the
 *    size is part of what the purchase buys. levelsOf() prices each one at
 *
 *        LEVEL_K x refHold(mine) x rateOfLayer(stratum) x LEVEL_GROWTH^(i-1)
 *
 *    which reads, in words: a level costs a fraction of ONE FULL HOLD of the
 *    rock it opens, and each level deeper costs half again as much on top. Both
 *    halves matter:
 *
 *      the rate term   makes a rich stratum expensive and a dead one cheap.
 *                      Deep Hollow's Dead Granite carries almost nothing, so the
 *                      station into it is nearly free — which is honest, and it
 *                      is the mine telling you the truth about itself.
 *      the growth term keeps the ladder rising even where two strata pay the
 *                      same, so "the next level down" is always a bigger
 *                      decision than the last one.
 *
 *    refHold is the CARGO CAPACITY at the rig tier this mine's recDrill implies
 *    (design note 4's own assumption, read straight off js/rig.js rather than
 *    copied), so the ladder tracks the workshop instead of drifting from it.
 *
 *    MEASURED, at 48 units of hold and Old Creek's own rates: the two Old Creek
 *    levels cost $200 and $380, and a hold worked out of the deeper one grosses
 *    ~$570 — so a company that buys both is inside Red Ridge's $1 600 of rights
 *    after three or four runs, which is the ladder the brief asks for. Every
 *    mine's table is in audit() under `levels`; re-read it after any retune.
 *
 * 4d. RAILS — THE LATERAL TWIN OF THE LIFT
 *
 *    The lift buys REACH; rails buy THROUGHPUT. Within one level a company lays
 *    track EASTWARD from the shaft and buys CHECKPOINTS along it, each of which
 *    can refuel (at a markup) and — the one that matters — SECURE the hold.
 *
 *    WHY THIS IS AN ECONOMY AND NOT A CONVENIENCE. Measured on the lift ladder:
 *    levels raise $/MINUTE, not $/RUN, because the HOLD binds long before the
 *    tank does. A deposit checkpoint removes exactly that binding constraint, so
 *    it raises $/RUN directly.
 *
 *    MEASURED, Blackstone's payoff level (Gold Pocket, 1020 m) at rig tier 2,
 *    one descent and one tank either way, same seam, same driving policy:
 *
 *        without a deposit checkpoint   $24 764/run    58 of 450 fuel spent
 *        with one                       $38 442/run   426 of 450 fuel spent
 *
 *    1.55x on $/run, and the fuel column is the real finding: a hold-bound run
 *    spends THIRTEEN PER CENT of its tank before the hopper sends it home. The
 *    checkpoint turns that into a fuel-bound run at 95%. The uplift is ~1.5 holds
 *    rather than three because the tank binds as soon as the hold stops — which
 *    is the correct next constraint, and it is what makes the tank the upgrade a
 *    player wants immediately after their first checkpoint. Re-measure this after
 *    any retune of CP_K: it is the only justification for the price.
 *
 *    checkpointsOf() prices each one at
 *
 *        CP_K x refHold(mine) x rateOfLayer(level's stratum)
 *              x CP_GROWTH^(k-1) x (1 + CP_DEPTH_K x depthKm)
 *
 *    which is levelsOf()'s equation with the compounding moved from DEPTH to
 *    DISTANCE, plus a mild depth term so that infrastructure 3 km down is dearer
 *    than the same infrastructure 300 m down even in a poor stratum.
 *
 *    THE TARGET THE COEFFICIENTS WERE SOLVED FOR, not chosen: the FIRST
 *    checkpoint on any level costs 0.5-1.0 full holds of that level's rate and
 *    the OUTERMOST costs 2-3. With CP_GROWTH 1.5 over 4 checkpoints the outer/
 *    inner ratio is fixed at 3.375, so the first must land in 0.593-0.889 holds
 *    for BOTH ends to be inside their band. CP_DEPTH_K 0.15 makes the depth term
 *    span 1.02 (Old Creek level 1, 135 m) to 1.45 (The Rift level 4, 3000 m),
 *    and CP_K 0.60 therefore puts every mine's first checkpoint in 0.61-0.87
 *    holds and every outermost in 2.07-2.94. Both bands hold by construction
 *    across the whole catalogue — audit()'s `rails` block prints the tables.
 *
 *    CP_PITCH_M x CP_PER_LEVEL IS BOUNDED BY THE MINE, not by taste, and the
 *    margin is THIN — measured against the shipped shaft, not assumed:
 *
 *        getMouthX()            -2280   (js/advterrain.js: -HALF_W + ELEV_INSET)
 *        + 4 x 120 m (4800u)    +2520   the outermost checkpoint's CENTRE
 *        MINE_HALF_WIDTH         2600   the east wall
 *        margin                    80 units
 *
 *    So four checkpoints at 120 m fit, and a FIFTH would be 1120 units outside
 *    the world. The cage (radius ADV.EXIT_RADIUS 200) does overhang the east wall
 *    by 120 units at k=4; that is harmless, because the cage is a service radius
 *    and not carved geometry — the centre is what has to be reachable.
 *
 *    >> CONSTRAINT FOR WHOEVER OWNS js/advterrain.js: ELEV_INSET must stay at or
 *    >> below 400, or the outermost checkpoint centre leaves the mine and
 *    >> CP_PITCH_M or CP_PER_LEVEL has to come down with it. This file cannot
 *    >> check that itself — it is pure data and must not read a live module — so
 *    >> it is written down here and asserted in the rails harness instead.
 *
 *    FUEL AT A CHECKPOINT IS DELIBERATELY A BAD DEAL (RAIL_FUEL_MARKUP 1.5).
 *    Filling at the surface has to stay the smart default or the tank stops being
 *    a decision; the markup is what you pay for not having planned. Always go
 *    through railFuelCost() — see the rounding note on fuelCost().
 *
 * 5. DEVICE HARDNESS COMPENSATION — the trap in this file
 *
 *    js/materials.js REWRITES `hardness` at load (applyWorldDensity) because a
 *    portrait phone generates the classic world on a coarser grid. Adventure
 *    mode does not: ADV.SPACING is a fixed 21 everywhere. So the hardness
 *    numbers this file reasons about are up to ~1.3x larger on a phone while the
 *    geometry is identical, and an uncompensated drill would fail to cut granite
 *    on exactly the devices we care most about.
 *
 *    deviceHardnessK() recovers that factor from the table itself
 *    (stone.hardness / stone.baseHardness) and js/rig.js multiplies drill power
 *    and hardness cap by it. Per-deposit PRICES and VOLUMES are deliberately
 *    NOT scaled: adventure's deposit count per square metre of mine is the same
 *    on every device, so the money must be too.
 *
 * 6. MATERIAL IDS ARE RESOLVED, NOT ASSUMED
 *
 *    Agent 3 appends the adventure materials to js/materials.js in parallel with
 *    this file. Every id used below goes through resolve(), which falls back to
 *    the nearest existing material BY ROLE (coal -> iron, silver -> gold, ...)
 *    if the real one has not landed yet. The mines therefore always have a
 *    working economy; it just degrades in flavour. Nothing here ever hard-codes
 *    a numeric material index — those are baked into the particle arrays and are
 *    Agent 3's to allocate.

   * THE CATALOGUE
   * ------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Seven mines. Each one exists to answer a different question, because a mine
   * that is only "the last one but bigger" is a menu entry, not a place:
   *
   *   Old Creek    teaches the loop, and is the only place you can afford
   *   Red Ridge    the first rock that resists: a fast soft sandstone bed and
   *                then a limestone bench that a worn auger cannot chew, plus
   *                the copper/iron money that pays for the first real hopper
   *   Blackstone   long tunnels through hard rock, silver veins, a gold pocket
   *                at the bottom — the first mine you can get LOST in
   *   Frostpeak    Deep Hollow's TWIN at the same price, with ZERO heat in every
   *                layer. The mine you run when your cooling is still tier 0 and
   *                Deep Hollow's floor would cook you in half a minute. It
   *                charges for that with the hardest non-granite rock in the
   *                game (hardnessScale 1.20) and 4% less money, so it wants
   *                DRILL and FUEL where its twin wants COOLING. See note 4a —
   *                these two are a fork in the map, not two rungs of a ladder.
   *   Deep Hollow  THE GAMBLE, and the mine the brief is really about. 220 m of
   *                dead granite at a pocket rate of 0.22 before anything pays,
   *                then a cavern floor stuffed with gold, crystal, platinum and
   *                the ancient formation. MEASURED: a starting machine reaches
   *                211 m of 700, surfaces with under 2 units of iron and nets
   *                MINUS $44; a tier-3 machine bottoms it, fills the hold from
   *                The Hollow and nets $63 344. That 1400x swing is the whole
   *                design, and both ends of it have to stay extreme.
   *   Cinder Fell  the opposite of Frostpeak: heat 0.85-1.00 for 560 m. Cooling
   *                is the ticket of entry, and obsidian pockets in the magma
   *                skin need drill tier 3. Where the two hazard axes cross.
   *   The Rift     everything at once, at 1200 m: geothermal vents, obsidian
   *                pressure locks, huge caverns and a floor of starcore,
   *                voidstone and ancient rock.
   *
   * ORDERED BY PRICE, ascending, and getStarterId() is LIST[0]. Keep it that way:
   * a price-sorted catalogue is the natural reading order for the world map, and
   * it makes a dominated mine (see note 4a) obvious at a glance.

   *   with the mining rights (there is no surface entry any more — the surface
   *   is UI only and you never drive it). A price of 0 is what makes "L1 is
   *   owned" a fact about the catalogue rather than a rule every caller has to
   *   remember, and js/adv.js's ownership count is anchored on it.
   *
   *   EVERY PRICE CARRIES OVER UNCHANGED. Band i>=2 opens layer i-1 (0-based),
   *   which is exactly the stratum the old level i-1 opened, and the growth
   *   exponent (i-2) is exactly the old `out.length`. So the ladder a company
   *   already paid for costs what it always cost, and design note 4c's measured
   *   numbers still hold — the indices moved, the economy did not.
   *
   * `depthTopM`/`depthBotM` are the BAND, which is what advterrain clamps
   * streaming to and what vehicle.js clamps position to. `depthM` is kept as an
   * alias of `depthTopM` because it is the number every screen was already
   * printing ("the depth of this level") and half the consumers read it.
   *
   * LIVE array, cached on the mine: js/adv.js holds the reference and walks it,
