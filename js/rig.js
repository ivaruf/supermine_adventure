 * SUPERMINE — js/rig.js                          [OWNER: Agent 2 — PROGRESSION]
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE MACHINE, AS NUMBERS. rig.js owns the eight upgrade categories, their
 * tiers, their prices, and the derived stats every other module reads. It holds
 * NO run state: fuel LEVEL is the run's business (js/adv.js), fuel CAPACITY is
 * the machine's and lives here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE EIGHT PARTS — the workshop draws exactly these, in this order
 *   drill    penetrate harder rock, faster           -> power, hardnessCap
 *   engine   move faster, shove through debris       -> speed, thrust
 *   tracks   grip and turn rate                      -> turn, climb
 *   fuel     stay under longer                       -> fuelCap
 *   cargo    fewer return trips                      -> cargoCap
 *   lights   see more of the cavern                  -> lightRadius
 *   scanner  read ore through walls                  -> scanRange
 *   cooling  survive the deep heat                   -> heatCap, heatShed
 *
 * DESIGN RULE FROM THE BRIEF: an upgrade should CHANGE WHAT YOU CAN DO, not
 * just add a number. Tier a drill so that each step crosses a real hardness
 * threshold from js/mines.js, so the player's thought is "now I can get into
 * Blackstone", not "now I have 12% more drill".
 *
 * VISUAL CONTRACT WITH js/vehicle.js (Agent 1)
 *   getPartFlags() returns a flat object of small integers, one per visible
 *   subassembly. vehicle.js switches geometry on those and NEVER reads tiers
 *   directly, so Agent 2 can re-tier freely without touching the renderer:
 *     { bladeTier, drills, grinders, treads, hopper, conveyor, magnets,
 *       lamps, stacks, radiators, armor }
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * ================  AGENT-2 DESIGN NOTES — READ BEFORE TUNING  ================
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * A. THE DRILL LADDER IS THE GAME'S SPINE
 *
 *    Read js/mines.js design notes 1 and 2 first; this table is the other half
 *    of that argument. Advance rate through solid rock is
 *        v = min(engineSpeed, ADV.SPACING * power / hardness)
 *    and each drill tier is chosen so that a NAMED material crosses from
 *    "grinding" to "cutting", and so that hardnessCap crosses a named wall.
 *
 *    Speeds below are units/second through that material, paired with the engine
 *    tier a player realistically owns at the same time, and measured with
 *    SM.mines.advanceRate(). "full" means the rock is not the limit any more.
 *
 *      tier 0  WORN AUGER BIT       power  8  cap  8.5   dirt/clay/coal/sandstone
 *              at full speed, stone 73%, limestone 65%, copper 56%, iron 45%,
 *              granite a miserable 25%. Cannot touch ancient rock, obsidian or
 *              bedrock.
 *      tier 1  TUNGSTEN BIT         power 13  cap 11.5   stone and limestone
 *              free, copper 91%, silver 69%, iron 58% -> RED RIDGE's bench
 *              limestone stops being the reason a run is slow. Cap clears the
 *              ANCIENT FORMATION (9.5, and 10.45 under the Rift's 1.10 scale).
 *      tier 2  COMPOSITE ROTARY     power 21  cap 14.0   copper, silver, gold
 *              and emerald all free, crystal 90%, granite 42%.
 *      tier 3  POLYCRYSTALLINE      power 35  cap 20.0   granite 59%, crystal
 *              full -> BLACKSTONE and DEEP HOLLOW stop eating whole tanks. Cap
 *              clears OBSIDIAN even under the Rift's 1.20 scale (19.2) ->
 *              the pressure locks and the Cinder Fell magma skin open.
 *      tier 4  THERMAL LANCE ARRAY  power 55  cap 25.0   granite 79%, starcore
 *              61%, ancient full, obsidian 31%.
 *      tier 5  PLASMA CORE BREAKER  power 84  cap 34.0   granite full, starcore
 *              80%, obsidian 40% and BEDROCK 25% of a 275 u/s machine — which
 *              is still faster than the STARTER moves through stone.
 *              Deliberately never 100% on either: those two stay the rocks that
 *              are always felt.
 *
 *    NOTE ON WHERE THESE HARDNESSES COME FROM. They are Agent 3's, read live out
 *    of SM.materials, and three of them landed a long way from what this file
 *    originally assumed: sandstone is 1.7 and not 2.8 (it is the FAST bed, not
 *    the barrier), limestone is 2.6 and not 1.7 (so IT is the barrier), and
 *    uranium is 4.4 and not 7.6 (so uranium is gated by HEAT, not by the drill).
 *    js/mines.js was re-cut around the real numbers; nothing here reads a
 *    hardness literal, so re-run SM.mines.audit() after any change on their side
 *    rather than trusting this comment.
 *
 *    Note what this makes true: nothing is ever locked. A tier-0 auger can
 *    physically reach the bottom of The Rift; it will take four tanks it cannot
 *    carry. That is the brief's "slow and burn fuel, not told no".
 *
 * B. FUEL IS TUNED AS ENDURANCE, NOT AS A NUMBER
 *
 *    Bigger machines burn more, so a tank that only grew with the tank would go
 *    backwards. The tanks are sized from a target ENDURANCE — seconds of
 *    ordinary working, meaning getBurnEstimate(0.6, 0.9) — checked against the
 *    modelled round trip of every mine (SM.mines.audit()):
 *
 *      tier   burn u/s   tank   endurance   modelled round trip it just covered
 *        0      1.07      175      164 s    Old Creek 43 u,  Red Ridge 86 u
 *        1      1.71      340      199 s    Red Ridge 94 u,  Blackstone 249 u
 *        2      2.54      620      245 s    Blackstone 251,  Frostpeak 286
 *        3      3.72     1100      296 s    Deep Hollow 429, Cinder Fell 547
 *        4      5.29     1850      350 s    The Rift 812
 *        5      7.43     3100      417 s    The Rift with the hold filled twice
 *
 *    Each mine STRANDS one tier below its recommendation and needs 40-50% of the
 *    tank at it. That remaining half is not slack — see the fuel tier table's
 *    own note for why, and for which number to move once real playtest figures
 *    exist. getBurnEstimate() is exported so js/adv.js's "reserve needed"
 *    warning and the prep screen's fuel slider agree with this table instead of
 *    inventing their own coefficients.
 *
 * C. WHY COLLECT RADIUS AND ARMOUR ARE NOT THEIR OWN CATEGORIES
 *
 *    Eight categories is the contract, and two derived stats still need a home:
 *      collect radius  rides on CARGO   — a bigger hopper has a bigger intake,
 *                      and it keeps "the hold" as one idea in the workshop.
 *      armour          rides on TRACKS  — tracks are the undercarriage, and the
 *                      heaviest visible part of the machine's silhouette. The
 *                      `armor` visual flag and getArmor() therefore always agree.
 *
 * D. DEVICE HARDNESS COMPENSATION
 *
 *    js/materials.js rewrites `hardness` upward on coarse-grid devices (see its
 *    tunables note) while adventure's grid is a fixed ADV.SPACING. Drill power
 *    and hardness cap are therefore multiplied by SM.mines.deviceHardnessK() so
 *    that what the drill can cut is identical on every screen. NOTHING ELSE is
 *    scaled — speeds, tanks, holds, prices and radii are all geometry or money.
 *
 * E. PRICES
 *
 *    A per-part multiplier over one shared geometric ladder
 *    (700 / 3 200 / 14 000 / 58 000 / 330 000), so the shape of every part's
 *    cost curve is the same and only its weight differs:
 *      drill 1.4 (the gate, and it should hurt)   engine 1.0   cargo 0.9
 *      cooling 0.8   fuel 0.7   tracks 0.6   scanner 0.55   lights 0.45
 *    Fully maxing the machine costs ~$2.60M; all seven sets of mining rights
 *    cost ~$0.77M. See js/mines.js design note 4 for the income side.
 *
 *    The tier-5 rung is 5.7x the tier-4 rung rather than the ladder's usual
 *    ~4.2x, and that is deliberate: a simulated greedy player finishes the map
 *    with The Rift paying ~$550k a run, so at the original 220 000 rung the
 *    entire final act was three runs long. At 330 000 it is five or six, which
 *    is about as long as an endgame should be when the player is already rich.

       *   tier 3 (20.0)  OBSIDIAN — 16.0, or 19.2 under the Rift's 1.20 scale.
       *                  The pressure locks and the Cinder Fell magma skin open.
       *   tier 5 (34.0)  BEDROCK — 26.0, the floor of the mine itself. Cut at

       * distance and drives back. Real play wanders two or three times that, so
